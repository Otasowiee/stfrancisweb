                It is a story one could conclude is a mere coincidence, that the past and present history leading to the dedication of St Francis Catholic Church, Ekenhuan ends up in May. It was May 11, 2002 that the original Church building was dedicated. And on May 13, 2023, the remolded Church building was rededicated.
              </p>
              <p>
                May 13, 2023 was exactly 21 years and two days since the first dedication by the Archbishop Emeritus, Most Rev. Dr. Patrick Ebosele Ekpu. His successor and Archbishop of the Metropolitan See of Benin City, Most Rev, Dr. Augustine Obiora Abubeze, came on May 13, 2023 to rededicate the reconstructed and renovated church building with all its "glisten and midas touch".
                The reconstructed and renovated Church building took about some 10 years to pull into shape, just as it was in putting the old Church build together for dedication. A coincidence too that May 11, 2002 and May 13, 2023 both fell on a Saturday. And Catholic Church history presents a twist of divine aura on both dates.
                On the one hand, church history allocates May 11 as the feast day of St. Ignatius of Laconi, probably unknown in our clime.
                Whereas, on May 13 is the feast of our Lady of Fatima. <br>
                <br> According to the new revised edition of the book, "Saint Companion for Each Day", the "unknown" saint was born on 10th December 1701. He was the second of seven children of his parents. He grew up an illiterate and delicate boy with frail health. 
                At 17, he fell seriously ill and promised his father that if God preserve his life, and he got well, he will offer his life to St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of our parish.
                </pr>
                <br>He did recover but never joined the Franciscan order. Instead, he joined the St. Benedict Friary near Calgiary, where on November 10, 1721, he was accepted as a Capuchin lay brother. He lived out the rest of his religious life to the ripe old age of 80 years.

            <p>
              The rededication of the church building on May 13 was equally timely, engendering the hope that the prayers offered to our Lady of Fatima would rekindle in the hearts of our congregation the words and prayer in the parish motto: "Constant and Persevering Recourse to Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament In union with Mary, Queen of the Most Holy Rosary".
              According to the pioneer Parish priest, late Very Rev. Fr. Prof. Alexander Dumme Nzemeke, "the emergence of St. Francis, from the human point of view, was a chance occurrence. It owes its birth to the establishment in 1968 of a Headmaster's Institute where Rev. Fr. Flanagan was in charge, and accordingly began to hold Sunday services for the Catholic students of the institution. From this stage, it eventually was taken over by students of the University of Benin, who after the establishment of the institution in Ekenhuan campus in 1975, c redominate amongst s worshippers. <br> But no one ever dreamt something of the size and stature of St. Francis of today would emerge; whatever structure was being set was considered to be temporary everything was intended to be only before the movement of the university to the main campus at Ugbowo.
              </pr> By 1978, preparations were under way for the building of the Church there even though the student body was to move there in November, 1979.<br>
              <br>Meanwhile, however, the situation at the Ekenhuan end had begun to acquire new dimensions. The worshipping community on Sundays gradually began to feature people living in the immediate vicinity of the Ekenhuan campus that by 1980, the vast majority of worshippers consisted of individuals living outside the walls of the campus.              
              <pr>
                The spiritual care of the worshippers at Ekenhuan campus was in the hands of Frs. Nzemeke, B.W. Dundon, H.S. Onwuneme and T.E. Uwaifo. It was mostly a Sunday, Sunday affair, for there were no masses on weekdays. But in 1987 when the Marian year was being celebrated it was felt that if regular attendance at Mass was required of the catholic faithful as befitting of this celebration, something could be done for the Ekenhuan campus worhippers in this respect. It appeared difficult at the time, but I tried out three morning masses within the week, namely, Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and the result was very encouraging.
                The Marian Year was concluded on August 15, 1988, and it appeared that holding daily Masses could be attempted. It was tried and we had to continue.  
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. M. A. Okei, wrote 21 years ago that the foundation stone of the original Church building was laid in 1991 after the dedication of St. Albert, Ugbowo in 1990.
              Mrs Okei, an octogenarian who still worships with us today, says that Fr. Nemeke took over the administration of St. Francis in 1992. The parish was already named St. Francis Catholic Church on October 4th 1991.

                Part of the church building collapsed in May 1992, and that delayed every effort but work resumed in September 1993.
                Since its dedication in 2002, along with the Rectory, the Church boasts of a storey building housing two Church halls.
                The shape of the original church building was semi-circular, with a low-lying roof. In its new look, the shape remains semi- circular but with a raised roof, leading to a redesign of the main Church auditorium complete with a gallery of the same shape to accommodate more worshippers. The central aisle leads to a new and bigger altar, bedecked with motifs. The statues of the Blessed Virgin Mary and of St. Francis of Assisi, adorn the altar with the pictures of eight Archangels seemingly watching from above the altar.
                <br>
                <br> The onerous task of renovating and reconstructing the church building began with the arrival of the Msgr. Benedict Etafor. He replaced the pioneering parish priest, Fr. Nzemeke, who retired in 2013 after 50 years in the priesthood. Msgr. Etafor has since returned to his diocese of Auchi after several years in the saddle to recreate the St. Francis new-look, bogged by a whole year of COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the paucity of funds.
                He left behind the young, energetic Fr. Alex Ejiofor, his assistant, who held sway, and, until the arrival of Very Rev. Fr. Andrew Obinyan, as the new Parish Priest.                 
                </pr>
                <br>Fr. Andrew Obinyan came in a "blaze" late 2022, and through his Midas' touch, afflicted the entire church building with glisten and awesome religious motifs of various shapes and sizes in and on the surrounding walls. The rest is history. Now, we can behold the beauty, the awesomeness, looming large in our faces, its walls anointed once again by his Grace, Archbishop Dr. Augustine Obiora Akubeze, as the congregation sang in unison: "We love the place of the Lord."
                <pr>
                <p>"Our story, past and present" will not be complete without talking about our priest-sons and daughters in religious life. Before the first dedication in 2002, the Very Rev. Fr. David Ogun, was ordained a Jesuit priest. He is the son of the late Pa Ogun, who died at over 100 years recently.
                  Thereafter, there was a fall in vocation among our children. The surge however was rekindled after dedication, with many of our children entering the religious orders.
                </p>
                <p>The first of the lot was Rev. Bro. Dennis Omem. He is of the Congregation of Brothers of St. Stephen in Onitsha, Anambra State. He finally professed on August 28, 2011. He currently holds the office of the Secretary General of his Congregation.
                  Rev. Sister Mary-Ursula Otaiho Agge was next. She took her final vows in with the Medical Missionaries of Mary, she is currently at her duty post in Malawi. We’ve since had another daughter who joined religious life in the person of Sr. Margaret Tejiri, who made simple profession with the Sisters of Our Lady of Apostles (OLA).
                  Rev. Fr. Joseph Osahon Osunde was ordained next. Ordained as Dominican Priest on July 18, 2015, and then Fr. Augustine Obodo Obiosa, who was followed by Fr. Christopher Orukpe Imoisili {2022} both of them also Dominicans. Fr. Osunde currently a works at St. Paul's Catholic Church, Portland in the Diocese of Maine, USA, while Obodo is stationed at St. Albert the Great Catholic Church, Obosi, Anambra State, Fr. Imoisili, the youngest of the three Dominicans is with the Dominican Community at Igue Edaken, Ekiadolor.                  
                </p>
                <p>The last on this growing list is Rev. Fr. Ifeanyichukwu Maximillian Omem, the kid-brother of Dennis. He was ordained in the Philippines on July 12, 2019 in the Order of Augustinian Recollects. He Is currently in Rome for further studies.
                  As we congratulate these priest-sons and daughter, let's pray for those of them in formation and for more vocation in our children.
